## About our project üìù
<hr>
HealthierU was created for coaches and atheletes to be able to communicate outside of the gym. HealthierU allows a coach to assign workouts and recipes for meals to their atheletes to allow them to be at their peak level of fitness. The website has a a easy user interface, allowing coaches to easily edit and delete assigned workouts. In the future we want the coach to be able to assign mealplans to their atheletes and make it more of a social media site where athletes and coaches can follow and communicate with eachother.
